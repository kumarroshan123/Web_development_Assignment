    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with thr properties,composition and behaviour of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the universe.</p>
    
    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <span style=" background-color: yellow;">periodic table</span> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol,such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>
    
    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i>. Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i>
    <br>
    <br>
    2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O
    <br>
    <br>
    This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>) and oxygen gas (<i>O<sub>2</sub></i>) to form water (<i>H<sub>2</sub></i>O).

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p> Stoichemistry is the calculation of  reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations it ensure mass and charge are conserved.
        <br><br>
        <sub>subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in s molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.
    </p> 
    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
